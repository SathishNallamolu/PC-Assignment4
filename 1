This problem is very challenging. Because we need to design a synchronization mechanism in such a way that multiple processes have to communicate each other without any problem. This has to be done by using the MPI library.

One more problem with this is,we again have to establish a communication environment between threads of a same process. This has to be done by OpenMP library.

Now,the big challenge infront of us is to make sure that all the processes are synchronized correctly and all the threads of a process are synchronized well.
But,we cant compile the mpi library using openmp.
